SLID?R

Create only one SVG image to be your presentation!


Usage:
- download the latest package of Slid?r
- modify presentation.svg or replace it with your own
- open index.html in FireFox4, Chrome or Safari (needs SVG support)
- use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through slides


Tips & Tricks:
- slides are defined as rectangles of name slide1, slide2, etc. located anywhere in the SVG
- you must have one "root" group that contains everything you want to be shown
- outline all of your texts (browsers don't handle real text well)
- if the height of a slide rect is larger than the width, it will be considered rotated 90 degrees CCW
